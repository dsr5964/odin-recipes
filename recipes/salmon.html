    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Salmon is a very easy fish dish to make. It can be modified in many
      different ways and it is not too heavy. It is a great source of protein
      especially when you don't want to eat red meat or chicken. You can add
      many garnishes and sides to add more to your salmon fish.
