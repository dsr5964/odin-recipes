    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken fajitas are an easy classic Mexican dish and one of my favorites
      to make. It provides a flavorful meal and it very healthy. It is important
      to season the chicken and tossing it with vibrant vegetables. It is
      perfect when wrapped with tortillas and toppings as well. My personal
      favorite toppings are sour cream, guacamole, and salsa, but feel free to
      customize the fajitas based on personal preference.

    <p>
      The fajitas are not only delicious and flavorful but they are fun for the
      entire family. The freedom of choice is what makes them fun as everyone
      has their own spin on the recipe. You can add peppers, onions, cheese,
      etc. You can even change out the meat for beef as well. Have fun making
      this great recipe for dinner!
